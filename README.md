# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

***

上面是 `create-react-app` 创建出来的模板内容。

这个项目的初衷是《[react 基础工程（react-redux & react-router）](https://blog.cchealthier.com/2023/05/31/react-basic-app/)》，然后就在上面顺便做一些练手项目。

### main 分支

基础的工程模板

### dev-advance 分支

增加了 `react-query` 的使用，增加了一些声明周期的使用，增加了一些 hook 的使用。

### ui-editor 分支

写了一个简单拖拽式 ui 生成界面编辑器，当前是用于编辑静态页面。所谓静态是指没有交互，比如生成一些微信活动场景页面那种。虽然为了示例用了 antd 的一些表单组件，但实际上没有交互作用。界面如下：
